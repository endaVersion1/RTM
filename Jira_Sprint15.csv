*I need to* be able to validate the Reason Code used when cancelling a motor tax disc 

*So that* I can be sure the appropriate criteria have been met 

This user story will be called when the user selects the “Continue” button on the Cancel Tax screen. It is tightly coupled with [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-58|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-58|smart-link], which is the user story responsible for displaying the Cancel Tax screen. 

This user story will apply validation to the selected Cancel Reason Code selected by the user via the dropdown list box on the screen. The following validation that must be applied: 

* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Stolen” there must be an active ""VEHICLE STOLEN"" alert on the vehicle
** If no active Stolen alert exists, an error message “Cannot select this reason code - no active stolen alert exists for the vehicle” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Scrapped / Destroyed”, the vehicle status must be ""SCRAPPED VEHICLE DESTROYED""
** If the vehicle status is not ""SCRAPPED VEHICLE DESTROYED"", an error message “Cannot select this reason code - vehicle status is not ""SCRAPPED VEHICLE DESTROYED""” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle ELV”, the vehicle status must be ""END-OF-LIFE VEHICLE""
** If the vehicle status is not ""END-OF-LIFE VEHICLE"", an error message “Cannot select this reason code - vehicle status is not ""END-OF-LIFE VEHICLE""” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
** If the ELV / COD Issued Date on system is greater than or equal to the Cancellation Start Date, an error message “Cancellation Start Date cannot pre-date ELV Date for the vehicle” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Exported”, the vehicle status must be ""EXPORTED""
** If the vehicle status is not ""EXPORTED"", an error message “Cannot select this reason code - vehicle status is not ""EXPORTED""” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
** If the Exported Date on system is greater than or equal to the Cancellation Start Date, an error message “Cancellation Start Date cannot pre-date vehicle export date” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Written Off by Insurer”, the vehicle status must be ""WRITTEN OFF BY INSURER""

# We are checking the vehicle status but we cant see the status in this cancelation screen so you need to go back and check which is the vehicle status in case of cancelation reason validation appear.
# The same for issue Date and export Date.

My question is, should we show/hide exportDate and issue date if exist? Also should we always show the vehicle status?

On the other hand, the date validation:

#  “Cancellation Start Date cannot pre-date ELV Date for the vehicle”
#  “Cancellation Start Date cannot pre-date vehicle export date”

Is correct that validation? …. should be “post-date“? In my opinion the cancelation date should be after export date/issue date, for example I cancel once the vehicle is exported not before….

There have been no requests to add these details to the Cancel Tax screen. I think we should not add those details unless the users request them. 

Regarding the wording of the error messages for ELV date validation and Export date validation, I’m not sure if the logic needs to be reviewed - I think it’s ok. For example, if the ELV Date is 16/06/2025, the Cancellation Date would need to be 01/07/2025, i.e. the first of the month following the ELV Date. We cannot have the Cancellation date pre-dating the ELV Date, e.g. we cannot set it to 01/06/2025, as the vehicle would need to have been taxed for the month of June, between 01/06/2025 and 16/06/2025. The same would be true for the Export Date. Does this make sense? Happy to discuss further if you need to talk it through. ","24/Jun/25 2:41 PM;637b90dc3e79f12e5720785a;Testing complete we need to make a code change 

* The NVDF does hold an ELV date in the elv_notification table – it holds both en_issue_dt and en_created_dt.
* The en_issue_dt is the date the vehicle was presented to the ATF and scrapped. 
* The en_created_dt is the date the ELV was recorded on the NVDF.
* The en_issue_date should be used as this is the date the MTO use to determine refund of motor tax applications.

Observations of cancelling on current MTO:

* Options are different
* Using “refund” as cancellation reason following tables are updated:
** vehicle_licence
** vehicle (update expiry date / update sord expiry date if needed)
** stock_cancel_issued
** off road declaration created for the rest of the time motor tax was still valid
** remove exemptions related to the cancellation (vehicle used didn’t have any so not sure about logic behind this yet)
* Vehicle licence issue date and vehicle licence end date used for validation of cancellation date",,,18356,MCR-7,Motor tax,Done,07/Jul/25 4:26 PM

* These Garage details are set up in Shannon and very few details should be updated by the MTOs.
* “Co. Reg”, “VAT” and “RSI” are never updated by MTO, but they still belong here as read only fields.
* “Rate a/c No” is mandatory and can be updated by MTO.
* “Plan” is an Alphanumeric field and refers to the Planning Application reference number.
* Garage name and all the address fields should not be updated by MTO, but they still belong here as read only fields.
* “Zip” is redundant here and can be removed from the screen.
* “Issued Identifier On” contains the date the garage code was issued?
* “Contact” is the garage contact; it’s never updated by the MTOs and can be removed from the screen.
* “Trade Status” is an important field, but it should never be updated by MTO.
* “Test Status” and “Test Type” are no longer relevant and can be removed from the screen.
* “Insurance” and “End” (i.e. insurance end date) are the primary fields that are updated by the MTO.
* “Comments” are not used that often, but we should retain them; they should remain editable by the MTO.
* The “Save” button saves the changes that have been made.
* The “Quit” button exits the screen and returns to the search screen without saving any changes.
* The “Next” button jumps to the next garage, which is not required and can be removed from the screen.
* The “View” button results in a new view only screen being displayed: 
** It shows similar details to this screen but does not allow any of the details to be updated.
** It also has additional buttons for the user, e.g. Trade Plate History. ","11/Mar/25 11:02 AM;637b90dc3e79f12e5720785a;*Test Notes*

*I need to* be able to view a list of garages that satisfy the search criteria provided

*So that* I can select the required garage 

If there is more than one garage that satisfies the garage advanced search criteria, a list of the garages that matched the search criteria is displayed. The MTO agent can view the list of garages that match the search criteria and select the required garage from the list displayed. This user story will deliver the _front end_ screen to display the list of garages that satisfy the advanced search criteria provided. 

The following columns will be included on the search results screen: 

* Garage Code
* Garage Name
* Town 
* County
* Trade Status
* VAT Number

By default, the search results are sorted by the Garage Code ascending. 

The fields “Trade Status” and “VAT Number” do not form part of the existing end point. This data will need to be retrieved from the database in order to  display the details on the search results screen. We have added a new technical task ( [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-455|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-455|smart-link] ) to retrieve these details. 

There is no limit to the number of garages that can be returned as a result of the garage advanced search functionality.

Pagination will be required for this screen; this will allow the user to quickly navigate through the list of garages that satisfied the search criteria. The default number of rows displayed in the search results table will be 10 rows per page. The user will be able to use “Previous” and “Next” pagination keys, as appropriate. 

If the contents of a field in the table exceeds the space available, the user will see three dots at the end of the displayed text (“…”). The user will be able to hover over the field and the full contents of the field will be displayed. 

If the user sees the record they are looking for, they may click on the corresponding “View” hyperlink on the right hand side of the screen to select the garage and move to the “View Garage Details” screen. This functionality will be delivered as part of user story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-28|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-28|smart-link]. 

However, if the user is still unsure which garage they are looking for, they can return to the Advanced Garage Search screen using the breadcrumbs hyperlinks and update the search criteria. When the user goes back to the advanced garage search screen, the previously entered search criteria will still be visible. From there, the user will be able to add to the search criteria, change it, or clear it, as required. 

We would like to be able to click on the Garage Code to select the garage as well as being able to click on the “View” hyperlink on the right hand side of the table. This approach is similar to the approach used to display the vehicle advanced search results.

Does this mean user won’t be able to change sorting and use other columns to sort by?

After conversation, we won’t add trade plate to results which means we need to remove it from the results, otherwise we will show duplicates
{panel}

[~accountid:70121:33f42efe-9a0a-4def-9b9f-a39fe5caf454] , if it’s ok I’m going to add tradePlate to the results as otherwise results will be confusing because it’s the only value that differs from the other ones … if not, we can remove the tradePlate from results and I guess then we can get unique results

*I need to* be able to search for a garage using a variety of different search criteria

*So that* I can view the details of the associated garage

User story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-265|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-265|smart-link] will deliver the font end for the advanced garage search screen. This user story will focus on delivering the _screen logic and validation_ associated with the screen.

The Garage Code is a unique identifier that allows us to identify a specific vehicle. If the Garage Code is not available, the MTO client will need to use other details to search for the garage, e.g. 

* Garage Name
* Trade Plate Number
* Town
* County
* VAT Number

Wildcard searches should be applied by default as part of the Advanced Garage Search screen; they will be implied, i.e. the user should not have to input an asterisk “*”.

There are no minimum length restrictions associated with the search criteria - the user can choose to enter as little as one character should they wish. Obviously, the more characters they enter the better for their search, but the screen will not need to enforce minimum lengths.

Once the MTO agent has entered the required search criteria, they can select the ""Search"" button to find the list of garages that match the search criteria. This user story will also deliver the required back end call to identify whether or not any garages match the search criteria provided.

The screen will require the user to use at least _two_ search criteria (including the County that defaults to the county associated with the user). If the user does not provide sufficient search criteria before they click on the “Search” button, the system will display an error message at the top of the screen stating “Please provide two or more search criteria”. 

{color:#ff5630}Note: we cannot call the end point to retrieve Garage data from the database until the new Garage service has been delivered, as discussed in Daily Scrum call on 27/03/2025.{color}

-If one garage matches the search criteria, the details of the garage are displayed on the next screen. User story- [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-266|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-266|smart-link] -will deliver the functionality to display the relevant garage details.-  {color:#006644}We have removed this requirement as it is inconsistent with the approach currently implemented for vehicles. If we have only one search result for a vehicle, we still display the search results screen. We will follow the same approach for garages.{color} 

If there are multiple garages that match the search criteria, the list of garages are displayed on the garage search results screen and the MTO agent will select the garage they are interested in from the list. User story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-27|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-27|smart-link] will display a list of the garages that satisfy the search criteria. 

If no garage matches the search criteria provided, the system will display a error message stating “Garage details not found” at the top of the screen.  

If the user selects the “Clear” button, the search criteria will be cleared, allowing the user to start another search with new search criteria.

If the user enters non-alphanumeric characters in any of the fields (e.g. !, &, #, etc.), a message will be displayed at the top of the screen stating “Alphanumeric characters only” and the offending field on the screen will be highlighted in red.

We don’t redirect to vehicle details if there is only one result.

*A bug was raised because this was not happening, I guess this is the line that needs to be modified* 

* _“If one garage matches the search criteria, the details of the garage are displayed on the next screen.”_ 

There is another thing that probably needs to be changed on this story:

* *The step on that scenario should say* *_“I enter two or more valid search criteria_**” as the minimum criteria is 2 for this advance search screen*

I’ve updated the acceptance criteria to enter two or more search criteria. 

Regarding the other point - if we only have one result for vehicles, we still display the search results screen, but with only one search result, right? If you can confirm that is the case, I can update the wording of this user story to ensure that it behaves in a consistent fashion.
