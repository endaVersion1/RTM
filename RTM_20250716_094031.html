      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to search for a vehicle using a variety of different search criteria \n\n*So that* I can view the details of the associated vehicle\n\nThe Vehicle Registration Number is a unique identifier that allows us to identify a specific vehicle. If the Vehicle Registration Number is not available, the MTO client will need to use other details to search for the vehicle, e.g. Chassis number, Engine number, etc.\n\nThe most commonly user search fields are as follows: \n\n* Chassis Number \n* Owner name\n* Engine Number\n\nThis user story will focus purely on _delivering the Advanced Vehicle Search screen_. None of the actual functionality to make the screen work will be delivered as a result of this user story; that will be delivered as part of user story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-3|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-3|smart-link] \n\nThe screen design included below has been agreed with the MTO representatives during our MTO workshop on 11th Dec 2024. \n\nWe will allow the user to search vehicle by:\n\n* Chassis Number\n* Engine\n* Registration number\n* MTO\n* Owner Surname\n* Owner Forename\n* Country\n* Town\n* Make\n* Model\n* Colour\n* Body Type\n* Vehicle Status\n* Tax class\n\nThe Vehicle Status field should default to “Current”, but the user can change this if required.\n\nThere will also be a "Clear" button to reset the search criteria if the MTO agent wishes to restart their search using different search criteria. \n\nThe dropdown list boxes will be loaded as part of this user story (see [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-120|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-120|smart-link]). Placeholder text for the dropdown list boxes will be “Please Select”.\n\n!image-20241216-111952.png|width=1149,height=1084,alt="image-20241216-111952.png"!</td>

The other boxes will be developed under different user stories for Search garage, Search Trailer, etc. \n\nThis screen will show 4 boxes that will allow the user to search by vehicle reg number, garage code and trailer code and sundry transactions.\n\nSearches will use full registration number and only if it matches with exact vehicle will show details for the vehicle, otherwise an error will be shown about vehicle/garage/trailer not found.\n\nNote: The scope of this Story only involves vehicle search by registration number without style.\n\nThe following screen will be delivered as part of this user story: \n\n!image-20241129-170940.png|width=1170,height=1020,alt="image-20241129-170940.png"!\n\nWe will deliver the “bare bones” screen displayed above as part of this user story.

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to search for a vehicle using the Vehicle Registration Number\n\n*So that* I can view the details of the associated vehicle\n\n----\n\nThe Vehicle Registration Number is a unique identifier that allows us to identify a specific vehicle. The Vehicle Registration Number is made up of a combination of alpha numeric characters. Any white space characters that are keyed by the user will need to be stripped out of the Vehicle Registration Number before the code initiates a search on the database. \n\nWhen the user keys any non-alpha numeric characters (other than white space characters) in a Vehicle Registration Number, the system must alert the user that non-alpha numeric characters are not allowed in the Vehicle Registration Number field. \n\n*Mandatory fields:*\n\n* Vehicle Registration No.\n\n*Original screen*:\n\n!image-20241007-112738.png|width=649,height=487,alt="image-20241007-112738.png"!\n\n\n\nScreens agreed with the MTO representatives: \n\n!image-20241128-153435.png|width=1460,height=1034,alt="image-20241128-153435.png"!\n\n\n\n!image-20241128-155032.png|width=1194,height=886,alt="image-20241128-155032.png"!\n\nOnce the user has entered a valid Vehicle Registration Number, they can select the "Search" button to find the vehicle in question. If the vehicle exists in the database, the details of the vehicle are displayed on the screen. If the vehicle does not exist in the database, the system will pop up a message informing the user that the requested Vehicle Registration Number could not be found.  \n\nThis search will be an *EXACT match only*. If the exact registration number provided can be found, the vehicle details will be displayed. If the exact registration number provided cannot be found, an error message is displayed to the user. There will be no wildcard searches on this screen. Wildcard searches will only come into play on the Advanced Search screen. \n\nOne validation that will need to be applied to the Vehicle Registration Number field is that the data provided must contain at least one number and at least one letter.</td>

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to process a payment for a tax class change \n\n*So that* the tax class change transaction can be completed\n\nThis user story will deal with delivering the _front end_ functionality for processing a payment. The payment screen will be displayed when the user selects the “Continue” button on the Change Tax Class screen. \n\nThe payment to be processed will be provided to this screen from the Change Tax Class screen. \n\nThe Transaction summary section of the screen will describe the transaction for which the payment is being taken. \n\nAs part of taking payment, the MTO agent must be able to record one or more payment types and the associated payment amounts. The payment types can be cash, card, postal order, cheque. The user must select the appropriate payment type and enter the amount. If more than one payment type is used to settle the transaction, the user must click on the “Add Payment” button to capture additional payment types and amounts. \n\nIf an additional payment is added by mistake, the user can select the “Remove” hyperlink alongside the payment to remove the payment from the transaction. \n\nThe values entered in the Payment Amount field cannot be negative. \n\n* If the user enters a negative payment amount, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Payment Amount cannot be a negative value”.\n\nIn the Payment Summary section at the bottom of the screen, \n\n* The Method field will be displayed as a drop down list box with the values “Counter” or “Postal”. The default value when the screen is displayed will be “Counter”. When the Method is “Counter”, no supporting data is required. However, when the Method is “Postal”, we will also need to capture the Postal Receipt Date in the format DD/MM/YYYY.\n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, the screen will dynamically update to display the required “Postal Receipt Date”. \n*** The Date Picker icon, which will allow the user to select a date using a date picking function, will be displayed to the right of the Postal Receipt Date to make it easier for the user to update the field\n*** The postal Receipt Date must be validated to ensure that it is a well formed / valid date that is not in the future. \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and they do not provide a Postal Receipt Date, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Postal Receipt Date is a required field”.  \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and they provide a Postal Receipt Date in the future, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Postal Receipt Date cannot be in the future”.  \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and they provide an invalid Postal Receipt Date, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Invalid Postal Receipt Date”.  \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and the screen dynamically updates to display the required “Postal Receipt Date”, and if the user then changes the Method back to “Counter”, the screen will dynamically update to hide the Postal Receipt Date.\n* The Payment Total field will display the total payment due for the transaction. \n* The Payment Amount field will display the total value of payments already entered by the user. \n* The Payment Remaining field will display the outstanding balance required to settle the transaction. \n\nThese payments must be recorded against the relevant licence renewal transaction. The payment details will be written to the database and will be available to form part of payment reports made available to the MTO agent and the MTO supervisor. \n\nWhen the payment details have been completed, and the user selects the “Process” button, the system will give the user the option to print a receipt. The printing of the receipt, etc. will be dealt with in the separate user story ([https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-643|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-643|smart-link])\n\nIf the user selects the “Process” button and insufficient payment has been entered, the system will pop up an error message saying “Insufficient funds have been provided”. The user will have to click the “OK” button to acknowledge the error message. \n\nIf the user selects the “Process” button and the payment amount entered by the user exceeds the payment required, the system will populate the “Change Due” field within the Payment Summary section of the screen with the difference between the “Payment Total” and the “Payment Amount”. The “Change Due” field is for information purposes only, to allow the user to determine what change they need to give the vehicle owner. The overpayment should not be recorded against the transaction, as the user will give the vehicle owner their change, based on the contents of the “Change Due” field. \n\nThe “Change Due” field will be dynamically displayed - if there is no change due to the vehicle owner, the field will not be displayed. If there is change due to the vehicle owner, the field will be displayed. \n\nIf the user selects the “Cancel Transaction” button, they will be returned to the View Motor Tax screen and all payment information will be discarded.\n\nThere is *no* limit to the number of payments that can be added to the transaction. In reality, the vast majority of transactions will be paid for using a single payment type. \n\nThere will be *no* restriction to prevent a user from creating multiple payments of the same type, e.g. two “Card” payments. \n\nIf the user adds two or more payments with the same type, e.g. €50.00 Cash and €75.00 cash, we will *not* need to roll the Cash payment figure up, e.g. resulting in one Cash payment of €125.00. \n\nIf the user chooses to refresh the screen, all of the data on the screen will be retained. \n\nThe Payment screen will look as follows: \n\n!image-20250428-114833.png|width=584,height=902,alt="image-20250428-114833.png"!</td>

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* calculate the Surcharge Amount when the Tax Class is changed during the current motor tax period\n\n*So that* the correct Surcharge Amount is charged based on the new Tax Class\n\nThis user story will deliver the calculation required to determine the Surcharge Amount due as a result of a Tax Class change for an existing tax disc.\n\nThe user story will accept the current Tax Class, the new Tax Class, the timeframe of the original tax disc (i.e. 3, 6 or 12 months), and the number of months that the surcharge is to be applied.\n\nThe system will calculate the Surcharge Amount based on the difference between the original fee paid and the rate of motor tax due for the new Tax Class from the start of the month in which the Tax Class change took place.\n\nIf the calculated Surcharge Amount is less than or equal to €0.00, there will be no charge applied for the Tax Class change. There will also be no refund given to the vehicle owner.\n\nThe following steps will ensure that the Surcharge Amount is calculated accurately and fairly when changing the Tax Class of a vehicle. \n\n*Surcharge Calculation Steps*\n\n# Determine the Cost per Month for the Current Tax Class:\n#* Take the total cost of the current tax disc.\n#* Divide this total cost by the total number of months covered by the disc to get the cost per month for the current tax class.\n# Determine the Cost per Month for the New Tax Class:\n#* Calculate the cost per month for the tax disc associated with the new tax class based on the same number of months as the original tax disc.\n# Calculate the Monthly Surcharge Amount:\n#* Subtract the original cost per month (current tax class) from the new cost per month (new tax class) to get the Monthly Surcharge Amount.\n#** The Monthly Surcharge Amount may be €0.00 or more. \n#** The Monthly Surcharge Amount should not be negative\n#*** If the Monthly Surcharge Amount calculation results in a negative value, we set the Monthly Surcharge Amount to €0.00\n#** The Monthly Surcharge Amount may include euro and cents, e.g. €23.65\n# Calculate the Total Surcharge Amount:\n#* Multiply the Monthly Surcharge Amount by the number of months remaining on the tax disc from the date that the Tax Class change applies to get the Total Surcharge Amount.\n#** The Total Surcharge Amount will be a value in euro. \n#** The Total Surcharge Amount may be zero, if the Monthly Surcharge Amount is zero. \n#** The Total Surcharge Amount will be rounded down to an even euro amount, e.g. €140.64 will be rounded down to €140.00.\n\n*Example Calculation*\n\n* Current Tax Class:\n** Total cost of the current tax disc: €333.00\n** Number of months covered by the disc: 12 months\n** Cost per month for the current tax class: €333.00 / 12 = €27.75\n* New Tax Class:\n** Total cost of the new tax disc: €544.00\n** Number of months covered by the disc: 12 months\n** Cost per month for the new tax class: €544.00 / 12 = €45.33\n* Monthly Surcharge Amount:\n** Monthly Surcharge Amount: €45.33 - €27.75 = €17.58\n* Number of Months Remaining:\n** Let's assume the Tax Class change applies for 8 months.\n* Total Surcharge Amount:\n** Total Surcharge Amount: €17.58 * 8 = €140.64; rounded down to €140.00.\n\n* Handling Negative Surcharge Amount:\n** If the value of the Surcharge Amount is negative (i.e., the new tax rate is lower than the old rate), there is no surcharge levied and there is no refund due.\n\n\n\nAdditional examples provided by Stephen O’Hare from the Meath MTO:\n\n*Example 1*\n\nM1 vehicle\nCustomer A taxes the vehicle as a taxi on the 02/01/2025 and pays €95.00.

This is to satisfy the scenario where an untaxed period needs to be accounted for using two different arrears with two different Tax Classes. For example, a six month unpaid tax period may be accounted for using a three month arrear with a “Private” Tax Class and a three month arrear with a “Goods” Tax Class. The costs associated with each of these three month arrears will be different as a result of the Tax Class used when adding the Arrear. \n\nCurrently, when adding a Gap, we capture a Gap Reason Code. In the future, we will capture a Tax Class in the same manner when capturing an Arrear. \n\nThis user story will deliver the _front end_ and _back end_ changes required to implement the capturing of Tax Class for each Arrear. \n\nWhen auto-generating an arrear as part of loading the Process Motor Tax screen, the Tax Class associated with the arrear will default to the Tax Class associated with the vehicle.\n\nThe Process Motor Tax screen will need to be changed to capture a Tax Class per Arrear. When the user selects the Arrear radio button, a Tax Class drop down list box will become available. This drop down list box will only contain the list of Tax Classes relevant for the Body Type of the vehicle in question. The drop down list box will default to the Tax Class currently associated with the vehicle. If necessary, the user will be able to change the Tax Class associated with the Arrear by selecting an alternative Tax Class from the drop down list box. \n\nThe fee associated with the Arrear will be based on the number of months covered by the Arrear and the monthly Arrears fee associated with the selected Tax Class. \n\nIt will be possible to have zero, one or more different Arrears / Tax Class combinations associated with an untaxed period. \n\nOnce the Arrear has been confirmed, the Untaxed Period table will be updated to include the Tax Class associated with the Arrear. \n\nThe new wireframe for the screen is as follows: \n\n!image-20250326-104004.png|width=442,height=847,alt="image-20250326-104004.png"!\n\nThe “stepper” that is included in the above wireframe will be delivered as part of a separate user story. \n\nIf the user selects “Gap”, the data in the action section displayed will change slightly, i.e. the “Arrears Cost” and the Tax Class dropdown list box will both disappear and the Gap reason code dropdown list box is displayed: \n\n!image-20250304-123529.png|width=612,height=1035,alt="image-20250304-123529.png"!\n\nHitting the “Confirm Action” button will add the arrear to the Untaxed Period table. \n\nHitting the “Cancel Action” button will cancel the add action and dynamically update the screen to remove the highlighted section of the screen. \n\nWhen this screen is being loaded, if any arrears are being auto-generated, the Tax Class will default to the Tax Class associated with the vehicle.\n\nIt will not be possible to create an arrear without selecting a Tax Class.</td>

See attached for the process map associated with this transfer of motor tax. \n\nWe agreed that this functionality would be accessed from the screen that displays the motor tax details for the original vehicle registration.

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to update the Tax Class associated with a vehicle’s tax disc\n\n*So that* the Tax Class accurately represents the usage of the vehicle\n\n*Background:*\n\nThe Tax Class associated with a vehicle is an important attribute. It is essential that it is kept up to date.\nArticle 7(c) of the 1992 act advises that when changing Tax Class, the owner should pay the difference between the licence originally issued and the amount payable at the new rate "for the like period". We view "for the like period" as meaning a disc with the same Start Date and End Date.\nThe following is an extract from the Dept of Transport regarding such occurrences and the change is generally considered to have occurred on the date of sale, not the date of presentation to the MTO.\n“If the change to the vehicle took place during a current motor tax period and gave rise to an increase in the rate of motor tax payable, you are required to pay the difference between the original fee paid and the higher rate of motor tax due, from the start of the month in which the change took place”\n\n*Requirements:*\n\nThis user story will focus on delivering the front end requirements to change the Tax Class associated with a tax disc.\n\nAs the Tax Class is not stored alongside the Tax Disc itself, the change of Tax Class here will result in the Tax Class of the vehicle being updated. \n\nNote: We’re adding some validation via [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-803|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-803|smart-link] which will prevent the user from getting to this screen if the status of the vehicle is not “Current “ or “Restricted Data Access Limited”. It makes no sense to change the vehicle’s tax class if the status is not one of these two values. \n\nUnder the “Relevant Details” section, the screen will display the current Tax Class associated with the vehicle and will also display the current Motor Tax dates, i.e. the Start Date and End Date of the current tax disc. The Current VRC Number is also included for reference. This VRC Number is the latest valid VRC Number associated with the vehicle.\n\nNOTE: In some scenarios, the most recent VRC record will not have a VRC Number populated, i.e. the certNumber associated with the current VRC record is empty. This is a valid scenario and can occur if there’s a VRC awaiting issue. If we find that the certNumber is empty and the status of the VRC record is “Awaiting Issue”, we should populate the Current VRC Number field on this screen with the text “Awaiting Issue”. This will ensure that the cashier is aware that there’s currently a VRC awaiting issue for this vehicle.\n\nThe user will be able to select a new Tax Class for the vehicle using the dropdown list box provided. The contents of the dropdown list box will be controlled based on the contents of the tax_class_body_type table. The New Tax Class must be different from the Current Tax Class.\n\n* If the user clicks on the “Continue” button without first selecting a valid New Tax Class an error message “New Tax Class is a mandatory field” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the New Tax Class field will be highlighted in red \n* If the user selects a New Tax Class that is the same as the Current Tax Class, the system will display a message at the top of the screen saying “New Tax Class cannot be the same as the Current Tax Class” and the New Tax Class field will be highlighted in red.\n\nAs well as selecting the new Tax Class, the user will be able to select the Change Start Date, i.e. the date from when the Tax Class change is to be applied. The Change Start Date will have to be the first day of a month and it will default to the start of the current month.

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to validate the new Tax Class selected as part of processing motor tax\n\n*So that* the appropriate Tax Class is selected\n\nWhen the user selects a new Tax Class as part of processing a motor tax renewal, there are a couple of validations that we need to apply to ensure that the selected new Tax Class is allowed. The validations were identified on 14/04/2025 when Silvia was reviewing the legacy system functionality. \n\nThe validations that need to be applied as part of this user story are as follows: \n\n* When the user selects the Tax Class of “Vintage/Veteran”, we must implement a check to ensure that the vehicle is a minimum of 30 years old, based on the year of vehicle registration. \n** If the vehicle is not a minimum of 30 years old and the user selects a Tax Class of “Vintage/Veteran”, we must pop up an error message saying "Year of manufacture must be 1995 or earlier for 'Vintage/Veteran' tax class". \n*** In this error message, the year of manufacture is dynamically updated based on the current year minus 30 years, e.g. 2025 - 30 = 1995. \n* When the user selects the Tax Class of “Own Goods” or “Other Goods” we need to ensure that the vehicle weights have been captured / recorded correctly. \n** Stephen Cumbers confirmed that he has seen vehicles registered with very small weights, e.g. 0kg, 1kg, etc.\n** Stephen recommended that we set a minimum weight of 500kg for a Goods vehicle. \n** If the vehicle weights have not been captured correctly (i.e. the weight is less than 500kg) and the user selects the Tax Class of “Own Goods” or “Other Goods”, we must pop up an error message saying "A vehicle with Unladen Weight Basis of Assessment must have a vehicle weight greater than or equal to 500kg". \n** We should hold the minimum weight value as a parameter in the system.\n** Unladen weight is the wt_ulw field in the vehicle_weight table.\n** We’ll need to call a new end point here to retrieve the weight data for the vehicle\n\nThese validations will need to be applied for the change of Tax Class as part of taxing the vehicle, and for the Tax Class selected as part of adding an Arrear.</td>

This user story will be responsible for making the changes to the front end and (where necessary) the back end to ensure that the correct dates are being used and that the correct screen labels are being used.  \n\nThe End Date is the original finish date for the SORD / Motor Tax record when it was first created. \n\nIf a SORD is terminated early, the Expiry Date field in the ORD table is populated with a revised end date. The actual End Date field in the SORD record in not updated. The Expiry Date is used to capture the date the SORD was interrupted. \n\nIf a Motor Tax Disc is terminated early, the Status Date field in the Vehicle Licence table is populated with the date that the motor tax disc was cancelled. In some cases, depending on the reason code that was selected, the End Date of the motor tax disc is updated to be the last day of the month of the date of cancellation. \n\nTo further complicate the matter, there is both a Tax Expiry Date and a SORD Expiry Date held on the Vehicle table. \n\nWe need to review the screens we have already delivered to ensure that we are correctly using the terms End Date and Expiry Date. If we are using the Tax Expiry Date or the SORD Expiry Date from the Vehicle table, it is ok to use the “Expiry Date” label. However, where we are using the End Date from either the ORD table or the Vehicle Licence table, we should be using the label “End Date”. \n\nThe screens that we need to address as part of this user story are as follows: \n\n# Process Motor Tax screen, Transaction Summary section at the bottom of the screen\n\n!image-20250411-093559.png|width=378,height=252,alt="image-20250411-093559.png"!\n\n# Process Motor Tax Payments screen, Transaction Summary section at the top of the screen\n\n!image-20250411-093726.png|width=302,height=320,alt="image-20250411-093726.png"!\n\n# Process Motor Tax Confirmation screen - arrange the dates so that they are side by side (Start Date - End Date)\n\n!image-20250411-093907.png|width=412,height=449,alt="image-20250411-093907.png"!\n\n# Process SORD screen, Transaction Summary at bottom of screen\n\n!image-20250411-094152.png|width=194,height=122,alt="image-20250411-094152.png"!\n\n# Process SORD Confirmation screen - arrange the dates so that they are side by side (Start Date - End Date)\n\n!image-20250411-094725.png|width=319,height=320,alt="image-20250411-094725.png"!</td>

This user story will focus on the _front end_ changes required to display the motor tax records for the vehicle. This screen will be accessible via a new “Motor Tax” tab on the “Vehicle Page”. \n\nUser Story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-440|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-440|smart-link] will be responsible for retrieving the motor tax data from the database. \n\nWithin this user story, we will be focussing on delivering the contents for the “Motor Tax” sub-tab within the “Motor Tax” tab on the “Vehicle Page”. The other sub-tabs for “Arrears”, “Gaps”, “SORD” and “Motor Tax history” will be delivered using separate user stories. \n\nDelivering the “Motor Tax” tab on the “Vehicle Page” will be the responsibility of this user story. The new “Motor Tax” tab will be at the same level as the existing “Main Details” tab. \n\nDelivering the “Motor Tax” sub-tab within the “Motor Tax” tab on the “Vehicle Page” will also be the responsibility of this user story. \n\nThe proposed wireframe is included below. The motor tax data will be displayed on the screen in tabular format, with the following motor tax details being included in the table: \n\n* Start Date\n* End Date\n* Status\n* Motor Tax Number\n* Sort / Type\n\nThe screen will be sorted by Start Date descending so that the most relevant / most recent motor tax entry is at the top of the list. Each table entry will have a “View” hyperlink on the right hand side of the row. The user can click on the “View” hyperlink to view the full details associated with the selected row. \n\nThere is no requirement for the user to be able to be able to sort or filter the contents of the table\n\nThis screen will be a read only screen, user won’t be able to make any changes to the motor tax data that is displayed.\n\nThe screen will include pagination. A maximum of 10 rows will be displayed at a time. \n\nBreadcrumbs will be available at the top of the screen. \n\nSelecting the “Tax Vehicle” button within the “Motor Tax” sub-tab will take the user to the “Process Motor Tax” screen, as already delivered via user story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-8|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-8|smart-link]. The same validations as described in [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-206|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-206|smart-link] and [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-438|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-438|smart-link] will be applied here to ensure that the owner is allowed to tax the vehicle. \n\nShould the user wish to return to view the primary details of the current vehicle, they simply click on the “Main Details” tab again. \n\nSelecting the “Back” button will return the user to the previous screen, i.e. the vehicle search screen.  \n\nThe “Untaxed Period” section at the top of the screen will dynamically display any untaxed period, if one currently exists for the vehicle. The logic for determining if an untaxed period currently exists has already been implemented as part of the “Process Motor Tax” functionality. If no untaxed period exists for the vehicle, the “Untaxed Period” section will be dynamically hidden. All we need to display is the untaxed period start date and end date.

      <td>*As* a cashier\n\n*I need to* be able to see the tax class associated with a vehicle\n\n*So that* I know how the vehicle is being taxed\n\nThis user story started life as a bug. When the process motor tax screen was being displayed, the current tax class associated with the vehicle should be displayed in the “Tax Class” dropdown list box. \n\nHowever, when we implemented the functionality to only allow the “Tax Class” dropdown list box to display the tax classes linked to the vehicle’s body type, the Tax Class was no longer being displayed by default in the dropdown list box. \n\nFurther investigation revealed that the issue was linked to dirty vehicle data.\n\nWe are using the tax_class_body_type table to link tax classes with body types. It turns out that there are records in the database with an invalid combination of tax class and body type and in these scenarios the “Tax Class” is not being defaulted in the dropdown list box. \n\nAs this is correct behaviour, we converted the bug to be a user story. \n\nIn this scenario we are defaulting the “Tax Class” dropdown list box value to “Please Select”. We are also showing a pop up message with the following text when the current “Tax Class” is not valid for the associated Body Type: “Tax class not valid for body type. Please select from list provided”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen testing on sit and taxing a vehicle \n[https://mto-client-ui-sit-mto.apps.npocp4.ap.dot.ie/mto/vehicle-page/M698345/vehicle-process-motor-tax|https://mto-client-ui-sit-mto.apps.npocp4.ap.dot.ie/mto/vehicle-page/M698345/vehicle-process-motor-tax]\n\n\n{color:#ff5630}*Actual:*{color}\n\nThe first time this screen is loaded tax class is not fulfilled\n\n!image-20250410-101746.png|width=2055,height=1091,alt="image-20250410-101746.png"!\n\n{color:#36b37e}*Expected*{color}[{color:#36b37e}*:* {color}|https://mto-client-ui-sit-mto.apps.npocp4.ap.dot.ie/mto/vehicle-page/M698345/vehicle-process-motor-tax]\n\nTax class has corresponding value</td>

If the dates are irrelevant, we will either display “N/A” or we won’t display them.  \n\nIn order to understand why certain gaps and arrears are required, the user needs to know if the vehicle is taxed, if it’s declared off road, if it has been exported and if it was sold. Without displaying these fields on the Process Motor Tax screen, the user will need to search elsewhere in the system to see what the dates are. It makes sense to add these details to the Process motor Tax screen now, so they user has all the relevant information while processing the motor tax transaction. \n\nThis user story will deliver the front end changes required to the Process Motor Tax screen to display the following: \n\n* Motor Tax Expiry Date\n* SORD Expiry Date\n* Sale Date\n* Export Date\n\nAll of this information should already be available to us, so we just have to dynamically display the details if they are relevant. The updated wireframe is as follows for a scenario where all dates are relevant: \n\n!image-20250403-203426.png|width=565,height=936,alt="image-20250403-203426.png"!\n\nFor the scenario where the Sale Date and Export Date are both not relevant, we will dynamically hide the row that included those two dates, as follows: \n\n!image-20250408-115257.png|width=627,height=999,alt="image-20250408-115257.png"!\n\nFor the scenario where the Sale Date is relevant, but the Export Date is not relevant, we will dynamically display the row that included those two dates. However, the Sale Date will be populated and the Export Date will contain “N/A”. This will be vice versa if the Sale date is not relevant but the Export Date is. For example:  \n\n!image-20250408-115428.png|width=593,height=953,alt="image-20250408-115428.png"!\n\n\n\nThe four fields will be dynamically displayed when they are relevant to the untaxed period of the current transaction. For example: \n\n* If the SORD Expiry Date is more recent than the Motor Tax Expiry Date, we only need to display the SORD Expiry Date, i.e. the Motor Tax Expiry Date will be “N/A”, and vice versa. \n* If there is a Sale Date associated with the vehicle, but the Sale Date pre-dates the untaxed period, it is not relevant to this transaction and it will not be displayed. \n* If there is an Export Date associated with the vehicle but the Export Date pre-dates the last tax disc / SORD, it is not relevant to this transaction and it will not be displayed.\n* If both Sale Date and Export Date are not relevant, we won’t display that row on the screen. \n\nAs well as dynamically displaying / hiding the four fields called out above, we will be changing the title of this top section of the screen from “Current Motor Tax Details” to “Relevant Motor Tax Details”.</td>

The scenario was found when the Test team looked at the Motor Tax Process Payment screen. They found that the user could set a date to any time in the past, as long as it was a valid date format. It makes no sense to allow a Postal Date from potentially 100’s or 1000’s of years ago. \n\nWhen we discussed this with Enda Casey and Stephen Cumbers, we agreed that the Postal Date should be limited to a maximum of three months in the past.\n\nThis user story will be responsible for adding this additional Postal Date validation to the Process Motor Tax Payment screen. \n\nIf the user provides a Postal Date that is more than three months in the past, the system will display an error message “Postal Receipt Date cannot be more than three months in the past” at the top of the screen and the Postal Date will be highlighted in red. \n\n!image-20250325-092500.png|width=642,height=985,alt="image-20250325-092500.png"!</td>

If the full untaxed period has been explained using a combination of gaps and arrears, the “Add Action” button will be disabled. \n\nIf the user removes one of the untaxed periods from the table, a new row will be added to the table to account for the remaining untaxed period. The “Add Action” button will become enabled and the user can then click on it to add a new gap or arrears to the untaxed period table. The new gap or arrear will account for some or all of the remaining untaxed period. \n\nIf the new gap or arrear accounts for all of the remaining untaxed period, the “Remaining untaxed period” row is replaced in the table by the new gap or arrear. \n\nIf the new gap or arrear accounts for only some of the remaining untaxed period, a new gap or arrear row is added to the table and the start and end dates associated with the “Remaining untaxed period” row are updated accordingly.\n\nSelecting the “Add Action” button will dynamically give the user the opportunity to provide details of the associated gap or arrear. Arrear will be selected by default, as follows:  \n\n!image-20250303-183158.png|width=50%,alt="image-20250303-183158.png"!\n\nIf the user selects “Gap”, the data action displayed will change slightly, i.e. the “Arrears Cost” disappears and the Gap reason code dropdown list box is displayed: \n\n!image-20250304-123529.png|width=612,height=1035,alt="image-20250304-123529.png"!\n\nThe grey area of the screen shown above will dynamically be displayed when the “Add Action” button is selected.  \n\nThe user must select either the Gap radio button or the Arrears radio button. The default will be Arrears. \n\nThe Start Date will default to the start date of the untaxed period that needs to be explained. The Start date will be locked - the user will not be able to edit it. \n\nThe End Date will default to the end date of the untaxed period that needs to be explained. The End date will be editable either manually or via the date picker. The End Date will always be the last day of a month. The End Date cannot be less than the Start Date. The End Date cannot be more than last day of the untaxed period. \n\nThe Arrears Cost field will only be displayed for Arrears; it will not be displayed for Gaps. It will be calculated according to the number of months difference between the Start Date and the End Date. The number of months will be multiplied by the arrears monthly fee as taken from the MOTOR_TAX_RATES table. \n\nThe Gap Reason Code will only be displayed for Gaps; it will not be displayed for Arrears. The user will be required to select the gap reason code from the drop down list box. There are some limitations to the Gap Reason Codes that can be selected, as follows: \n\n* “Gap Past Owner” may not be selected if there is no Date of Sale within the Remaining Untaxed Period. \n* -“Gap Motor Dealer” may not be selected if the vehicle owner is not a Garage / Motor Dealer.- \n\nIf “Gap Past Owner” -or “Gap Motor Dealer”- options are not valid, they should not be included in the dropdown list box. \n\n-By default, the dropdown list box should be set to “Gap Past Owner”.-\n\nThe gap reason code dropdown list box should not default to any reason code. The “Gap Past Owner Unlicenced” reason code should appear at the top of the list of available reason codes, if it is applicable (i.e. if there has been a date of sale during the untaxed period). \n\nHitting the “Confirm Action” button will add the gap or arrear to the Untaxed Period table. \n\nHitting the “Cancel Action” button will cancel the add action and dynamically update the screen to remove the highlighted section of the screen. \n\nThe list of current Gap Reason codes are as follows: \n\n* HG: GAP CAR HIRE\n* GD: GAP DIPLOMATIC STAFF\n* GE: GAP DUE TO EXPORT\n* GS: GAP DUE TO SCRAPPAGE\n* GX: GAP EXEMPT VEHICLE IN USE\n* GC: GAP MOTOR DEALER\n* GR: GAP REFUND\n* GV: GAP VINTAGE VEHICLE\n* GU: GAP PAST OWNER UNLICENSED</td>

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to display gaps and arrears associated with an untaxed period for a vehicle \n\n*So that* the motor tax of the vehicle is up to date\n\n*Background:*\n\n* All vehicle owners are legally required to have motor tax on their vehicle if it is being driven on a public road.\n* Motor tax should be paid when due, but if the motor tax lapses on a vehicle for more than a month, the owner of the vehicle will be liable to pay arrears.\n* An arrears period can only exist if there is a full month's gap between the expiry date of the previous tax period and the beginning of the current month.\n* Arrears are charged based on the number of months of arrears due, multiplied by the monthly arrears fee. \n* The arrears monthly fee usually works out at one-tenth the value of the annual motor tax rate for the vehicle.\n* Arrears are calculated using data stored in the MOTOR_TAX_RATES table.\n* There are no fees associated with Gaps.\n\nThis user story will focus on the _front end_ changes to the “Process Motor Tax” screen to implement the functionality behind the “Remove” button in the “Untaxed Period” section of the screen. \n\nThe agreed wireframe design is included below:\n\n!image-20250303-123746.png|width=702,height=1007,alt="image-20250303-123746.png"!\n\nIf there are gaps or arrears for the vehicle, the “Untaxed Period” section will be visible and populated on the screen. The “Untaxed Period” section of the screen will be dynamically displayed only when there are gaps and / or arrears to display.   \n\nAny gaps or arrears will be displayed in tabular format, as per the wireframe included above. \n\nEach row in the table will have a “Remove” hyperlink on the right hand side. When the “Remove” button us selected, the associated untaxed period (i.e. the Gap or Arrear) is removed from the table. Once the Gap or Arrears is removed from the table, there is still a requirement for the user to explain the untaxed period. A new row is automatically added to the table showing the start and end dates of the untaxed period that still needs to be explained. So, if the Arrear was removed from the screen above, the untaxed period data would be displayed as follows: \n\n!image-20250303-180729.png|width=745,height=1059,alt="image-20250303-180729.png"!\n\nThe Type of this new row that is inserted in the table is “Remaining Untaxed Period”. The Start Date will be the start date of the untaxed period that remains. The End date will be the end date of the untaxed period that needs to be explained. There is no Reason Code and there is no Cost associated with this row. Finally, there is no “Remove” button associated with this row. \n\nWhen there are no arrears entries in the Untaxed Period table, the “Untaxed Period Due” cost will not be included in the “Transaction Summary” section of the screen. However, if an arrears entry is added, the “Untaxed Period Due” cost will be dynamically included in the “Transaction Summary” section of the screen and the value of the “Untaxed Period Due” will be included in the “Total” field. \n\nIf the user hits the F5 key to refresh the screen at this point, the Untaxed Period row that was removed will _not_ be reloaded. The contents of the Untaxed Period table will remain as it was before the F5 key was pressed. However, if the user hits the browse back button, or if the user selects a breadcrumb to jump to a different screen, the contents of the Untaxed Period table will be discarded. \n\nIf the user also removed the Gap from the screen above, the untaxed period data would be displayed as follows: \n\n!image-20250303-174928.png|width=764,height=1062,alt="image-20250303-174928.png"!\n\nWe will never have an occasion where two “Remaining Untaxed Period” entries are adjacent to each other in the table. In the above instance, there two entries in the table will be rolled up into one “Remaining Untaxed Period” entry. \n\nIf the user clicks on the “Continue” button at the bottom of the page and the full untaxed period has not been explained using a combination of gaps and arrears, a pop up message will be displayed on the screen saying “Cannot continue until all remaining untaxed periods are accounted for. Use the Add Action button to add a gap or an arrear.”\n\nIt is possible to have more than one “Remaining Untaxed Period” entry in the Untaxed Period table, but there will never be two “Remaining Untaxed Period” entries adjacent to each other. The scenario where more than one exists would be similar to the screenshot included below: \n\n!image-20250304-124535.png|width=672,height=1089,alt="image-20250304-124535.png"!</td>

[https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-38|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-38|smart-link].\n* There are scenarios where a combination of gaps and arrears need to be cleared before taxing a vehicle. \n* The attached process flow explains the high-level steps involved in identifying gaps and arrears.\n* This user story will determine if an untaxed period exists, and within that period, what time can be seen as gaps and what time can be seen as arrears.\n\n*Validation:*\n\n* If the vehicle is currently taxed or if a SORD (Statutory Off Road Declaration) exists for the vehicle, gaps or arrears cannot exist as they would have been dealt with during previous taxing/off-road declaration.\n* If the most recent tax or SORD expired less than a month ago, gaps or arrears cannot exist.\n* If there is at least one full month's gap between the expiry date of the previous tax period (or SORD) and the beginning of the current month, then gaps and/or arrears exist and must be dealt with.\n\n*Key Information:*\n\n* The Date of Sale is crucial in determining whether a gap or an arrear is used to clear an untaxed period.\n* If no Date of Sale exists, and the vehicle has never been taxed or declared off road, we must refer to the registration date of the vehicle.\n* Another crucial date is the Date Exported, which can be used to determine whether or not the vehicle was out of the country during the untaxed period. \n\n*Gaps and Arrears Logic:*\n\n* Identify the Date of Sale (if one exists).\n* Identify the Date Exported (if one exists).\n* Calculate start date and end date associated with the untaxed period:\n** Start Date:\n*** Always the first day of a month\n*** not less than first of month following expiry of last motor tax or SORD\n**** If the vehicle was never sold, taxed or declared off road, the Start Date will be the Registrations Date.\n*** not more than first day of the month prior to the current month\n** End Date:\n*** Always the last day of a month\n*** not less than start date\n*** not more than last day of the month prior to the current month\n* Determine how the untaxed period is to be divided:\n** If a Date of Sale exists, and it falls within the untaxed period, determine how much is to be gapped and how much is to be recorded as arrears.\n*** If the current vehicle owner is a garage / motor dealer, use a gap to explain the untaxed period.\n**** Any untaxed period relating to the months prior to the month of the Date of Sale must be processed as a gap.\n***** Gap type: “Gap Previous Owner” ({{GAP PAST OWNER UNLICENSED}})\n**** Any untaxed period relating to the month of the Date of Sale up to the month prior to today must be processed as a separate gap.\n***** Gap type: “Gap Motor Dealer”\n*** If the current vehicle owner is not a garage / motor dealer\n**** Any untaxed period relating to the months prior to the month of the Date of Sale must be processed as a gap.\n***** Gap type: “Gap Previous Owner” ({{GAP PAST OWNER UNLICENSED}})\n**** Any untaxed period from the month of the Date of Sale to the end of the month prior to the current month must be processed as arrears.\n** If no Date of Sale exists, or if Date of Sale predates the start of the untaxed period, check if the vehicle was exported during the untaxed period.\n*** If the vehicle was exported, the date the vehicle was exported will be available on the system. \n**** This can be used to determine the start date for the export.\n**** The start date for the export will be the first day of the month following the Date Exported. \n**** The MTO cashier should manually confirm the date the vehicle was brought back into the country, i.e. the end date for the export.\n***** We can default the end date for the export to be the last day of the month prior to the current month.\n**** If the vehicle was exported during the untaxed period, raise a gap for the time the vehicle was out of country.\n***** Gap type: “Gap Exported”\n*** There may still be arrears due on the vehicle if the export gap does not fully cover the untaxed period.\n**** Any untaxed period from the month of the end date for the export to the end of the month prior to the current month must be processed as arrears.\n** If no Date of Sale exists and the vehicle was not exported\n*** The full untaxed period must be recorded as arrears.\n\n*Outcome:* Once all of the gaps and arrears have been identified, launch the "Process Motor Tax" screen and display the data to the user.\n\n*Examples:*\n\n# No arrears\n## Vehicle tax

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to process a payment for a vehicle licence transactions \n\n*So that* the vehicle licence transaction can be completed\n\nThis user story will deal with delivering the _front end_ functionality for processing a payment. The payment screen will be displayed when the user selects the “Continue” button on the Process Motor Tax screen. \n\nThis will be the first iteration of processing a payment for a licence renewal transaction. The screen will be capable of taking payment for a single transaction. The payment to be processed will be provided to this screen from the Process Motor Tax screen. \n\nThe Transaction summary section of the screen will describe the transaction for which the payment is being taken. \n\nAs part of taking payment, the MTO agent must be able to record one or more payment types and the associated payment amounts. The payment types can be cash, card, postal order, cheque. The user must select the appropriate payment type and enter the amount. If more than one payment type is used to settle the transaction, the user must click on the “Add Payment” button to capture additional payment types and amounts. \n\nIf an additional payment is added by mistake, the user can select the “Remove” hyperlink alongside the payment to remove the payment from the transaction. \n\nThe values entered in the Payment Amount field cannot be negative. \n\n* If the user enters a negative payment amount, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Payment Amount cannot be a negative value”.\n\nIn the Payment Summary section at the bottom of the screen, \n\n* The Method field will be displayed as a drop down list box with the values “Counter” or “Postal”. The default value when the screen is displayed will be “Counter”. When the Method is “Counter”, no supporting data is required. However, when the Method is “Postal”, we will also need to capture the Postal Receipt Date in the format DD/MM/YYYY.\n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, the screen will dynamically update to display the required “Postal Receipt Date”. \n*** There will be three buttons to the right of the Postal Receipt Date to make it easier for the user to update the field\n**** The Date Picker icon, which will allow the user to select a date using a date picking function. \n**** The “Today” button will update the Postal Receipt Date to be today’s date. \n**** The “Clear” button will clear the contents of the Postal Receipt Date field. \n*** The user will be able to key in the Postal Receipt Date. \n**** If they key in two digits for DD, the cursor will automatically jump to MM.\n**** If they key in two digits for MM, the cursor will automatically jump to YYYY.\n*** The postal Receipt Date must be validated to ensure that it is a well formed / valid date that is not in the future. \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and they do not provide a Postal Receipt Date, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Postal Receipt Date is a required field”.  \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and they provide a Postal Receipt Date in the future, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Postal Receipt Date cannot be in the future”.  \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and they provide an invalid Postal Receipt Date, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user clicks on the “Process” button. The error message will state “Invalid Postal Receipt Date”.  \n** If the user selects a Method of “Postal”, and the screen dynamically updates to display the required “Postal Receipt Date”, and if the user then changes the Method back to “Counter”, the screen will dynamically update to hide the Postal Receipt Date.\n* The Payment Total field will display the total payment due for the transaction. \n* The Payment Amount field will display the total value of payments already entered by the user. \n* The Payment Remaining field will display the outstanding balance required to settle the transaction. \n\nThese payments must be recorded against the relevant licence renewal transaction. The payment details will be written to the database and will be available to form part of payment reports made available to the MTO agent and the MTO supervisor. \n\nWhen the payment details have been completed, and the user selects the “Process” button, the system will issue a paperless tax disc and give the user the option to print a receipt. The printing of the receipt, etc. will be dealt with in the separate user story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-210|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-210|smart-link]  \n\nIf the user selects the “Process” button and insufficient payment has been entered, the system will pop up an error message saying “Insufficient funds have been provided”. The user will have to click the “OK” button to acknowledge the error message. \n\nIf the user selects the “Process” button and the payment amount entered by the user exceeds the payment required, the system will populate the “Change Due” field within the Payment Summary section of the screen with the difference between the “Payment Total” and the “Payment Amount”. The “Change Due” field is for information purposes only, to allow the user to determine what change they need to give the vehicle owner. The overpayment should not be recorded against the transaction, as the user will give the vehicle owner their change, based on the contents of the “Change Due” field. \n\nThe “Change Due” field will be dynamically displayed - if there is no change due to the vehicle owner, the field will not be displayed. If there is change due to the vehicle owner, the field will be displayed. \n\nIf the user selects the “Cancel” button, they will be returned to the Process Motor Tax screen and all payment information will be discarded.\n\nThere is *no* limit to the number of payments that can be added to the transaction. In reality, the vast majority of transactions will be paid for using a single payment type. \n\nThere will be *no* restriction to prevent a user from creating multiple payments of the same type, e.g. two “Card” payments. \n\nIf the user adds two or more payments with the same type, e.g. €50.00 Cash and €75.00 cash, we will *not* need to roll the Cash payment figure up, e.g. resulting in one Cash payment of €125.00. \n\nIf the user chooses to refresh the screen, all of the data on the screen will be retained. \n\nThe new Payment screen will look as follows: \n\n!image-20250206-125455.png|width=705,height=865,alt="image-20250206-125455.png"!\n\nIf a second payment type is required the user will press the “Add Payment” button to allow the capture of an additional payment:\n\n!image-20250306-111615.png|width=735,height=831,alt="image-20250306-111615.png"!\n\nIf the “Postal” Method selected, a Postal Receipt Date must be captured: \n\n!image-20250130-105557.png|width=675,height=893,alt="image-20250130-105557.png"!\n\nThe current payments screen is as follows:\n\n!image-20241018-093216.png|width=340,height=256,alt="image-20241018-093216.png"!</td>

In this scenario, the vehicle can be declared off the road. It is important to note that the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance - it cannot be retrospectively be declared off the road. At present, an off road declaration can be made for a minimum of three months and a maximum of twelve months. Discussions are ongoing regarding making off road declarations open ended. There is no fee for declaring a vehicle off the road. \n\nThe start date for a SORD will always be the first of a month. The end date for a SORD will always be the last day of a month. \n\nThere are some restrictions regarding declaring a vehicle off the road, e.g. a vehicle cannot be declared off the road if there are tax arrears associated with the vehicle, or if tax arrears have just been cleared. If tax arrears have just been cleared, the vehicle must be taxed for a minimum of three months before it can be declared off the road. \n\nThe functionality to declare a vehicle off the road will be covered in separate user stories, e.g. [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-14|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-14|smart-link]. \n\nThis screen will be launched via the “Declare Off Road” button at the bottom of the “Primary Details” vehicle page: \n\n!image-20250114-103037.png|width=101,height=41,alt="image-20250114-103037.png"!\n\nWhen the “Declare Off Road” button is selected, the SORD screen will launch.

It is important to remember that the date of registration is considered to be day 1 of the 21 days allowed. If the owner waits for more than 21 days, they will not be able to declare the vehicle as off the road - they’ll need to tax the vehicle. Tax will be due from the date that the vehicle was registered in the state. Depending on the date of registration, there could be arrears implications here too.\n\nProcessing of the registration of new / imported vehicles must be completed before a SORD can be processed; this is a paper exercise, not a system one. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that all of the appropriate paperwork is in order. \n\nThis type of SORD will have a SORD Start date of the 1^st^ of the month of the registration date. \n\nThis 21 day period validation will be applied when the user selects the “Declare Off Road” button at the bottom of the “Primary Details” vehicle page.\n\n* If the owner is within the 21 day period, they will be taken to the Declare Off Road screen.\n* If the owner is trying to declare a vehicle off the road more than 21 days after the registration date of the vehicle, an error message will be displayed: “Vehicle cannot be declared off the road as vehicle registration date is more than 21 days ago. Vehicle must be taxed for a minimum period before an off road declaration can be made.”\n** The error message will be displayed in a pop up format, with an OK button that the user can click to acknowledge the message.</td>

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to licence a vehicle \n\n*So that* vehicle taxes are paid when required\n\n\n\nThis user story will deal with delivering the _front end_ screen for licencing a vehicle. The Process Motor Tax screen will be displayed when the user selects the “Tax vehicle” button on the Vehicle Primary Details screen. This “Tax Vehicle” button will also be implemented as part of delivering this user story. \n\nThere will be several validations carried out before the Process Motor Tax screen is displayed. These validations will be dealt with as part of a separate user story ([https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-206|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-206|smart-link])  \n\nThe legacy system has a slightly more complicated tax renewal screen than the one we will be building here. The legacy system deals with licence renewals, licence replacements and licence replacements free-in-lieu. However, because we are moving to paperless tax discs in Jan 2026, there will be no need to deliver functionality related to replacement tax discs or replacement free-in-lieu tax discs. The new screen will focus purely on licence renewals. \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, this screen will allow the user to select one of three different periods for licencing the vehicle: quarterly, half year and annual. The licence period will not default to any one of the three options when the screen loads. The user will need to select the required licence period before they can move forward with the taxing process. \n\nThe exception here is when a vehicle can _only_ be licenced annually, in this instance, the quarterly and half-yearly periods will not be available to be selected. The decision as to whether or not a vehicle must be taxed annually is based on the contents of the MOTOR_TAX_RATES table. For any vehicle type in the MOTOR_TAX_RATES table where the half yearly and quarterly values are zero, the vehicle must be taxed on an annual basis. If the vehicle can only be taxed on an annual basis, the quarterly and half-yearly renew options will not be displayed; only the annual option and it’s associated fee will be visible to the user. \n\nThe total licence renewal payment due will depend on the length of the licence period selected, the assessment class and the tax assessment value, available from the MOTOR_TAX_RATES table. \n\nThe user will only need to confirm the Tax Class and select the Taxing Period on this screen. \n\nTax Class is being added to this screen as it is a logical attribute to have displayed when dealing with motor tax renewals. If the vehicle has never been taxed before, the Tax Class will not be populated and the user will be required to select the appropriate Tax Class for the vehicle before the vehicle can be taxed. Until a Tax Class is selected, the screen will be unable to display the cost associated with quarterly, half-yearly and annual tax renewal. Only when the Tax Class is populated will the associated costs be displayed. \n\nIf a different Tax Class is selected for the vehicle by the user, the associated costs for quarterly, half-yearly and annual tax renewal will be updated accordingly. The new Tax Class selected by the user will be saved  against the vehicle as part of the taxing of the vehicle.\n\nIf the Tax Class is blank and the user does not select one from the drop down list box, an error message will be displayed at the top of the screen when the user selects the “Continue” button. The message will state “Motor tax class cannot be empty”. \n\nThe Tax Class drop down list box will only display the valid Tax Classes that are relevant for the vehicle Body Type. This will ensure that the user cannot select an invalid Tax Class from the drop down list box. \n\nIf the user does not select one of the available Taxing Periods, a pop up error message will be displayed when the user selects the “Continue” button. The message will state “Please select a Taxing Period”. \n\nThe Licence Start Date will default based on the following logic: \n\n* First taxing of a vehicle - defaults to the first day of the month of date of registration, as long as the vehicle is being taxed in the month of registration.\n** Otherwise, defaults to the start of the current month.\n* Tax renewal in month of expiry - defaults to the first day of the next month, assuming that the current Motor Tax expires in the current month.\n* Tax renewal in month following Tax expiry - defaults to the first day of the current month, assuming that the previous Motor Tax expired at the end of the previous month.\n* Tax renewal with arrears - defaults to the first day of the current month\n* Taxing following a CVO, tax already expired - defaults to the first day of the month of sale, as long as the vehicle is being taxed in the month of sale.\n** Otherwise, defaults to the start of the current month.\n* Taxing following a CVO, tax expiring in month of sale - defaults to the first day of the next month, as long as the vehicle is being taxed in the month of sale.\n** Otherwise, defaults to the start of the current month.\n\nThe Transaction Summary details will automatically update based on the Taxing Period selected by the user. \n\nThe “Continue” button will persist the user selections for Tax Class and Taxing Period and take the user forward to the payments screen. The payment processing for licencing a vehicle will be dealt with separately as part of another user story ([https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-209|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-209|smart-link]). \n\nThe “Add Vehicle” button will follow the same logic as the “Next” button in the current system; it will be delivered as part of a separate user story ([https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-243|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-243|smart-link])\n\nThe “Cancel” button will abandon any changes and return the user to the Vehicle Primary Details screen. \n\nThe wireframe for the screen looks as follows: \n\n!image-20250225-130604.png|width=963,height=498,alt="image-20250225-130604.png"!\n\n!image-20250130-104402.png|width=684,height=765,alt="image-20250130-104402.png"!\n\nIn the scenario where the Tax Class has not yet been selected (i.e. a new vehicle registration) the screen will look as follows when it first loads: \n\n!image-20250130-104520.png|width=669,height=744,alt="image-20250130-104520.png"!\n\nTax Class will be blank, and as a result, the Taxing Period values will be unavailable. \n\nIn the situation where arrears exist, the value of the arrears due will be calculated based on the period that the vehicle was untaxed. This calculation will be based on the number of months since the last licence expiry date until the current month, multiplied by the arrears rate that is available from the MOTOR_TAX_RATES table. However, the screen delivered as part of this user story will _not_ deal with Arrears. The functionality required to process Arrears will be covered by a separate user story. \n\n*Initial layouts*\n\n!image-20241007-152131.png|width=1009,height=719,alt="image-20241007-152131.png"!\n\n!image-20241007-152151.png|width=972,height=696,alt="image-20241007-152151.png"!\n\n!image-20241007-152239.png|width=1167,height=731,alt="image-20241007-152239.png"!</td>

They appear at the top of the screen and the user may click on the hyperlinks to jump back one or more steps to a previous screen. \n\nWe will implement breadcrumbs at the top of the MTO Client Replacement system, as follows: \n\n!image-20241216-120112.png|width=1168,height=136,alt="image-20241216-120112.png"!\n\n\n\nAs part of our implementation, we must be able to follow the breadcrumbs back to the previous screens that we stepped through to get to the current point in the system. This includes being able to step back to a search results page. For example, if we do an advanced vehicle search that returns five entries on the Vehicle List page, and we select one of these entries to view the vehicle, we need to be able to step back to the Vehicle List page that displayed the five vehicles that satisfied the search criteria. The same five vehicles should still be visible on the Vehicle List screen; we do not want to have to re-enter the search criteria and re-run the search - the data should remain readily available through the breadcrumbs.</td>

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to view a list of vehicles that satisfy the search criteria provided  \n\n*So that* I can select the required vehicle \n\nIf there is more than one vehicle that satisfies the vehicle search criteria provided, a list of the vehicles that matched the search criteria is displayed. They MTO agent can select the required vehicle from the list displayed.  \n\nThe search results are not well sorted in the legacy system (they’re sorted by Vehicle Registration Number) and it can be difficult to find the vehicle the user is interested in. \n\nBy default, the search results on the new system will be sorted by vehicle registration date descending, and then by vehicle registration number ascending. This should ensure that the most recently registered vehicles will be displayed first. To ensure full visibility, the Vehicle Registration Date will be displayed on the right hand side of the screen.  \n\nThe Vehicle Registration Number will be the first column on the left hand side of the screen. Also included will be the Make, Model, Owner Name, Town, County and Registration Date. This should be sufficient for the user to determine which vehicle they are looking for. \n\nThe tabular screen design agreed with the MTO representatives is as follows: \n\n!image-20241216-102907.png|width=1174,height=928,alt="image-20241216-102907.png"!\n\nPagination will be present on the screen. The default number of rows displayed in the search results table will be 10 rows per page. The user will be able to use “Previous” and “Next” pagination keys, as appropriate. \n\nIf the contents of a field in the table exceeds the space available, the user will see three dots at the end of the displayed text (“…”), as per the screen design above. The user will be able to hover over the field and the full details of the field will be displayed. \n\n{color:#ff5630}NOTE: Breadcrumbs functionality has not yet been delivered; this will be delivered as part of a separate user story in a future sprint. {color}\n\nIf the user sees the record they are looking for, they may click on the corresponding “View” hyperlink on the right hand side of the screen to select the vehicle and move to the “View Vehicle Details” screen. \n\nHowever, if the user is still unsure which vehicle they are looking for, they can return to the Advanced Search screen using the breadcrumbs hyperlinks and update the search criteria. \n\nIf possible, we would like to be able to click on the Vehicle Registration Number to select the vehicle as well as being able to click on the “View” hyperlink on the right hand side of the table.</td>

      <td>*As* internal staff\n\n*I need to* be able to search for a vehicle using a variety of different search criteria \n\n*So that* I can view the details of the associated vehicle\n\nUser story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-117|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-117|smart-link] will deliver the Advanced Vehicle Search screen itself. This user story will focus on delivering the screen logic and validation associated with the screen. \n\nThe Vehicle Registration Number is a unique identifier that allows us to identify a specific vehicle. If the Vehicle Registration Number is not available, the MTO client will need to use other details to search for the vehicle, e.g. Chassis number, Engine number, etc.\n\nThe most commonly user search fields are as follows: \n\n* Owner name\n* Chassis \n* Engine Number\n\nThe owner name is currently one field for both forename and surname, separated by a comma. For the new system, the Forename and Surname will be two separate fields. \n\nThe advance vehicle search screen will require the user to use at least three different search criteria. The one exception here is for Chassis Number - if the user enters a full 17 character Chassis Number, no other search criteria will be required. \n\nThe following restrictions apply for the search criteria:\n\n* Vehicle Registration Number\n** A minimum of 3 characters must be entered for the Vehicle Reg Number field if the user wishes to use it as part of their search.\n** should contain alpha numeric characters only. \n** must insist that the user enters at least one number and one letter if they wish to use the Vehicle Registration Number as part of their search\n* Chassis Number\n** A minimum of 6 characters must be entered for the Chassis Number field if the user wishes to use it as part of their search.\n** should contain alpha numeric characters only. \n** should not contain the letter “i” or the letter “o”; this restriction was introduced by the motor industry to avoid confusion with the numbers “1” and “0”. \n* Engine Number\n** should contain alpha numeric characters only. \n** must insist that the user enters a minimum of 4 characters if they wish to use the Engine Number as part of their search\n\n\n\nOnce the MTO agent has entered three different search criteria, they can select the "Search" button to find the list of vehicles that match the search criteria. If only one vehicle exists in the database, the details of the vehicle are displayed on the screen. If there are multiple vehicles that match the search criteria, the list of vehicles are displayed on the screen and the MTO agent can select the vehicle they are interested in from the list. \n\n{color:#ff991f}-With GDPR in mind, it has been agreed that we will limit the number of rows returned by any search on this screen. The number of rows may vary according to the role of the user and it must be configurable to allow us increase / decrease the number quickly and easily. Initially, a max limit of 20 search results will be returned for Cashiers, and a max limit of 50 will be returned for Supervisors. If the max allowed limit is exceeded as a result of the search criteria provided, no results are returned / displayed. Instead, an error message is displayed advising the user to be more specific with their search by adding further search parameters.-{color}\n\n{color:#ff991f}-If no vehicle matches the search criteria provided, the system displays an error message that the requested vehicle could not be found.-{color}\n\n{color:#ff991f}The GDPR / results returned restriction functionality has been moved out of this user story and in to user story {color}[https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-148|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-148|smart-link]{color:#ff991f} {color}\n\n\nThere will also be a "Clear" button to reset the search criteria if the MTO agent wishes to restart their search using different search criteria. \n\nFollowing discussions with the MTO Supervisors, they confirmed that wildcard searches should be applied by default as part of the Advanced Search screen. They should be implied, i.e. the user should not have to input an asterisk “*”.\n\nIn the legacy system, including “Town” in a vehicle search appears to kill the system performance, causing the system to take a long time to return search results. For the new system, we need to ensure that the inclusion of “Town” does not have a detrimental impact on the time it takes to return the search results. \n\nScreen validation will be applied once the user clicks on the “Search” button. \n\nThe agreed screen design for the Advanced Vehicle Search screen, as agreed during the MTO workshops, is as follows:   \n\n!image-20241216-112014.png|width=1149,height=1084,alt="image-20241216-112014.png"!\n\nAny validation error messages will be displayed at the top of the screen and the associated field will be highlighted in red.</td>
