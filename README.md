# Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) Generator

## Overview
This web app generates a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) Excel document by combining data from Jira and TestRail exports. It helps QA and project teams track requirements, test cases, and their coverage in a single, filterable Excel file.

## Features
- Upload Jira and TestRail CSV files
- Automatically map and merge relevant fields
- Generates an Excel RTM with columns:
  - Jira ID, Jira Summary, Test Case IDs, Test Case Titles, Test Case Status, Sprint, Jira Status, Jira Updated, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Jira Link, Test Case Links, Tested On
- Hyperlinks to Jira and TestRail for easy navigation
- Filterable columns in the Excel output

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App
1. Start the Streamlit web app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   If you get a 'streamlit not recognized' error, use:
   ```
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. The app will open in your browser. Upload your Jira and TestRail CSV files as prompted.
3. Review the RTM table in the browser and download the Excel file.

## Notes
- Jira and TestRail CSVs should have the expected columns (see sample files for reference).
- TestRail links are generated by removing the leading 'T' from test case IDs.
- Acceptance Criteria is mapped from the Jira column 'Custom field (Acceptance Criteria)'.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing columns or errors, check your CSV file formats and column names.
- For further customization, edit `app.py` as needed.
