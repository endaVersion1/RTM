*I need to* be able to validate the Reason Code used when cancelling a motor tax disc 

*So that* I can be sure the appropriate criteria have been met 

This user story will be called when the user selects the “Continue” button on the Cancel Tax screen. It is tightly coupled with [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-58|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-58|smart-link], which is the user story responsible for displaying the Cancel Tax screen. 

This user story will apply validation to the selected Cancel Reason Code selected by the user via the dropdown list box on the screen. The following validation that must be applied: 

* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Stolen” there must be an active ""VEHICLE STOLEN"" alert on the vehicle
** If no active Stolen alert exists, an error message “Cannot select this reason code - no active stolen alert exists for the vehicle” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Scrapped / Destroyed”, the vehicle status must be ""SCRAPPED VEHICLE DESTROYED""
** If the vehicle status is not ""SCRAPPED VEHICLE DESTROYED"", an error message “Cannot select this reason code - vehicle status is not ""SCRAPPED VEHICLE DESTROYED""” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle ELV”, the vehicle status must be ""END-OF-LIFE VEHICLE""
** If the vehicle status is not ""END-OF-LIFE VEHICLE"", an error message “Cannot select this reason code - vehicle status is not ""END-OF-LIFE VEHICLE""” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
** If the ELV / COD Issued Date on system is greater than or equal to the Cancellation Start Date, an error message “Cancellation Start Date cannot pre-date ELV Date for the vehicle” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Exported”, the vehicle status must be ""EXPORTED""
** If the vehicle status is not ""EXPORTED"", an error message “Cannot select this reason code - vehicle status is not ""EXPORTED""” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
** If the Exported Date on system is greater than or equal to the Cancellation Start Date, an error message “Cancellation Start Date cannot pre-date vehicle export date” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.
* If the user has selected a reason code of “Vehicle Written Off by Insurer”, the vehicle status must be ""WRITTEN OFF BY INSURER""
** If the vehicle status is not ""WRITTEN OFF BY INSURER"", an error message “Cannot select this reason code - vehicle status is not ""WRITTEN OFF BY INSURER""” will be displayed at the top of the screen and the “Cancel Reason” field will be highlighted in red.","*Scenario 1: Validate Reason Code - Stolen*

This user story will focus on delivering the _front end_ functionality for the View Garage Details screen.  

This user story will ensure that the _front end_ function is in place to display all the relevant garage details and present them to the View Garage Details screen for display. The retrieval of the data from the database will be covered as part of user story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-28|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-28|smart-link] 

The Garage Code, Garage Name and Company Registration Number will be displayed at the top of the screen, under the “Garage Details” heading. These three fields will remain as the header at the top of all the garage-related screens. This is a similar approach to the one used for viewing a vehicle. 

If the user selects the “Back” button, they will be returned to the previous screen. 

The functionality behind the “New Trade Plate” button will be delivered as part of user story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-311|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-311|smart-link], [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-538|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-538|smart-link] and [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-36|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-36|smart-link].

*I need to* be able to view a list of garages that satisfy the search criteria provided

*So that* I can select the required garage 

If there is more than one garage that satisfies the garage advanced search criteria, a list of the garages that matched the search criteria is displayed. The MTO agent can view the list of garages that match the search criteria and select the required garage from the list displayed. This user story will deliver the _front end_ screen to display the list of garages that satisfy the advanced search criteria provided. 

The following columns will be included on the search results screen: 

* Garage Code
* Garage Name
* Town 
* County
* Trade Status
* VAT Number

By default, the search results are sorted by the Garage Code ascending. 

The fields “Trade Status” and “VAT Number” do not form part of the existing end point. This data will need to be retrieved from the database in order to  display the details on the search results screen. We have added a new technical task ( [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-455|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-455|smart-link] ) to retrieve these details. 

There is no limit to the number of garages that can be returned as a result of the garage advanced search functionality.

Pagination will be required for this screen; this will allow the user to quickly navigate through the list of garages that satisfied the search criteria. The default number of rows displayed in the search results table will be 10 rows per page. The user will be able to use “Previous” and “Next” pagination keys, as appropriate. 

If the contents of a field in the table exceeds the space available, the user will see three dots at the end of the displayed text (“…”). The user will be able to hover over the field and the full contents of the field will be displayed. 

If the user sees the record they are looking for, they may click on the corresponding “View” hyperlink on the right hand side of the screen to select the garage and move to the “View Garage Details” screen. This functionality will be delivered as part of user story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-28|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-28|smart-link]. 

However, if the user is still unsure which garage they are looking for, they can return to the Advanced Garage Search screen using the breadcrumbs hyperlinks and update the search criteria. When the user goes back to the advanced garage search screen, the previously entered search criteria will still be visible. From there, the user will be able to add to the search criteria, change it, or clear it, as required. 

We would like to be able to click on the Garage Code to select the garage as well as being able to click on the “View” hyperlink on the right hand side of the table. This approach is similar to the approach used to display the vehicle advanced search results.

User story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-265|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-265|smart-link] will deliver the font end for the advanced garage search screen. This user story will focus on delivering the _screen logic and validation_ associated with the screen.

The Garage Code is a unique identifier that allows us to identify a specific vehicle. If the Garage Code is not available, the MTO client will need to use other details to search for the garage, e.g. 

* Garage Name
* Trade Plate Number
* Town
* County
* VAT Number

Wildcard searches should be applied by default as part of the Advanced Garage Search screen; they will be implied, i.e. the user should not have to input an asterisk “*”.

There are no minimum length restrictions associated with the search criteria - the user can choose to enter as little as one character should they wish. Obviously, the more characters they enter the better for their search, but the screen will not need to enforce minimum lengths.

Once the MTO agent has entered the required search criteria, they can select the ""Search"" button to find the list of garages that match the search criteria. This user story will also deliver the required back end call to identify whether or not any garages match the search criteria provided.

The screen will require the user to use at least _two_ search criteria (including the County that defaults to the county associated with the user). If the user does not provide sufficient search criteria before they click on the “Search” button, the system will display an error message at the top of the screen stating “Please provide two or more search criteria”. 

{color:#ff5630}Note: we cannot call the end point to retrieve Garage data from the database until the new Garage service has been delivered, as discussed in Daily Scrum call on 27/03/2025.{color}

-If one garage matches the search criteria, the details of the garage are displayed on the next screen. User story- [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-266|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-266|smart-link] -will deliver the functionality to display the relevant garage details.-  {color:#006644}We have removed this requirement as it is inconsistent with the approach currently implemented for vehicles. If we have only one search result for a vehicle, we still display the search results screen. We will follow the same approach for garages.{color} 

If there are multiple garages that match the search criteria, the list of garages are displayed on the garage search results screen and the MTO agent will select the garage they are interested in from the list. User story [https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-27|https://digitalhubjira.atlassian.net/browse/MCR-27|smart-link] will display a list of the garages that satisfy the search criteria. 

If no garage matches the search criteria provided, the system will display a error message stating “Garage details not found” at the top of the screen.  

If the user selects the “Clear” button, the search criteria will be cleared, allowing the user to start another search with new search criteria.

If the user enters non-alphanumeric characters in any of the fields (e.g. !, &, #, etc.), a message will be displayed at the top of the screen stating “Alphanumeric characters only” and the offending field on the screen will be highlighted in red.
